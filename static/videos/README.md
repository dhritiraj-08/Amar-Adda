# Video Background Instructions

To add your event videos as background:

## Video Requirements:
- **Format**: MP4 (recommended) and/or WebM for better browser support
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **File size**: Keep under 50MB for faster loading

## Video Content Ideas:
1. **Entertainment Events**: Concert footage, performances, crowd reactions
2. **Collaboration Events**: Team meetings, brainstorming sessions, partnerships
3. **Crowd Management**: Event organization, audience engagement
4. **Technical Production**: Camera work, lighting setups, sound equipment
5. **Behind the Scenes**: Production team in action, equipment setup

## How to Add Videos:
1. Place your video file in this folder (`static/videos/`)
2. Name it `events-showcase.mp4` (or update the filename in `templates/index.html`)
3. Optionally add a WebM version for better browser compatibility

## Current Setup:
- The video will autoplay, loop, and be muted by default
- A dark overlay is applied for better text readability
- If no video is found, a gradient background with Amar Adda colors will show

## Tips:
- Use video editing software to create a seamless loop
- Ensure the video showcases your best work and team capabilities
- Consider adding multiple videos and rotating them with JavaScript
